    	<p>Kirito is a lone anti-hero who prefers going alone. He has a kindred soul when he takes the blame the death of his first guild and for Diabel's death by the others who are harassing the Betas, and he gladly accepts being named a Beater. Because of his guilt and inability to move on, he does not join a guild or party. Even under all those circumstances, he is actually a kind, warm-hearted, and understanding person. He will do anything to save the life of his friends just to avoid the same mistake he made, often putting his own life at risk.</p>	
    	<p>Kirito (キリト) is the main protagonist of the <a href="http://swordartonline.wikia.com/wiki/Kirito">Sword Art Online</a> light novel, anime and manga series. His name, Kirito, was taken from his real name Kirigaya Kazuto.</p>
